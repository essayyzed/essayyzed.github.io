What does that actually mean for companies navigating this new technology frontier? What challenges are holding them back, and what drives those who embrace it? Most intriguingly, where has generative AI proven its worth in transforming workflows and outcomes?\n\n## A Rocky Road to AI Adoption\n\nThe promise of generative AI is nothing short of revolutionary. It can create content, automate customer service, accelerate software development, and unlock insights from mountains of data. Yet, despite the hype, the reality of enterprise adoption tells a sobering story.\n\nA 2025 [MIT study, *The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025*](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) revealed that a staggering **95% of enterprise generative AI pilot projects fail to deliver measurable business impact or ROI**. The study, based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and analysis of 300 public AI deployments, found that the core issue isn't the quality of AI models, but rather a \"learning gap\" between tools and organizations. The research showed that more than half of generative AI budgets focus on sales and marketing tools, yet the biggest ROI comes from back-office automation—eliminating business process outsourcing and operational costs. This misalignment means companies are underinvesting in areas where AI could deliver substantial cost savings.\n\n### The Knowledge Barrier\n\nThe biggest obstacle is knowledge — or rather, the lack of it. Research from the [AI Accelerator Institute's 2025 Generative AI Report](https://www.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/why-companies-arent-using-generative-ai/) found that **46.2% of companies cite lack of understanding** of generative AI capabilities as the primary reason for avoiding implementation. This knowledge gap manifests in two critical ways: companies either underestimate AI's potential, missing valuable opportunities, or overestimate its capabilities, leading to disappointment when results don't match inflated expectations.\n\nMany organizations face challenges in aligning AI's vast potential with real business needs. The study revealed that understanding exactly how generative AI models work, how to train them effectively, and how to correctly integrate and derive value from them requires substantial expertise in machine learning principles—expertise that many organizations simply don't possess internally.\n\n### Data Privacy and Trust\n\nData privacy concerns represent a critical implementation barrier. The [AI Accelerator Institute study](https://www.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/why-companies-arent-using-generative-ai/) found that **30.8% of enterprises identify compliance and data security risks** as a major obstacle, particularly in regulated sectors like healthcare and finance where inadvertent data exposure through AI model use poses significant risks. \n\nBeyond privacy, trust remains elusive. **27.2% of non-adopters don't trust generative AI** due to its unpredictable nature and tendency to produce inconsistent results. This lack of confidence is particularly problematic in business-critical applications where accuracy and reliability are paramount. The concern stems from generative AI's known tendency to make mistakes or produce results that deviate from intended outcomes, making it difficult for companies to fully rely on it for critical decisions.\n\n### Integration and Cost Complexities\n\nLegacy systems create substantial integration challenges. [Panorama Consulting's 2024 analysis](https://www.panorama-consulting.com/generative-ai-adoption-challenges/) of generative AI adoption challenges found that many organizations struggle with data silos, inconsistent data formats, and incomplete datasets that hinder AI model performance. Integrating data from disparate sources into formats suitable for AI training proves daunting for most enterprises.\n\nThe computational demands are equally formidable. Generative AI models require substantial processing power and storage capacity, often straining existing IT infrastructure and necessitating significant technology investments. Costs escalate quickly beyond initial implementation—ongoing maintenance, security protocols, and specialized talent acquisition add layers of expense. Industry estimates place complex generative AI solutions at costs ranging from $500,000 to several million dollars, depending on scale and customization requirements.\n\n## Why Some Choose to Embrace Generative AI\n\nDespite formidable hurdles, organizations that strategically adopt generative AI are seeing meaningful results. The [MIT study](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) revealed that success often stems from strategic approach rather than technology sophistication.\n\n### The Path to Success: Strategic Implementation\n\nThe research highlighted critical success factors that differentiate the 5% of successful implementations from failed projects. Companies that buy specialized AI solutions from vendors achieve **67% success rates**, compared to only 33% for full internal builds. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that proprietary, internally-developed solutions deliver superior results.\n\n[DealHub's 2025 AI Readiness Assessment](https://dealhub.io/blog/cio/ai-readiness-assessment-is-your-company-prepared/) found that only **13% of companies globally are ready to leverage AI technologies to their full potential**—a figure that has actually declined from the previous year. This creates a paradox where companies rush to deploy AI solutions while discovering that technology alone cannot bridge the gap between experimentation and meaningful business impact.\n\n### Real-World Workflows Benefiting from AI\n\n[McKinsey's analysis](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) of generative AI's economic potential, covering 63 use cases across 16 business functions, found that **approximately 75% of the value that generative AI could deliver falls across four key areas**: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development.\n\n#### Customer Operations Excellence\nResearch conducted on a company with 5,000 customer service agents found that generative AI implementation increased issue resolution by **14% per hour** and reduced time spent handling issues by **9%**. The technology also reduced agent attrition and requests to speak to managers by **25%**. Productivity improvements were most pronounced among less-experienced agents, with AI assistance helping them communicate using techniques similar to their higher-skilled counterparts.\n\nCompanies like Air India have achieved remarkable results, with AI handling **97% of 4+ million customer queries** through full automation. [McKinsey estimates](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase productivity at a value ranging from **30 to 45% of current function costs**.\n\n#### Marketing and Sales Transformation\nMarketing teams using AI for automated blog writing, social media content, and campaign personalization report accelerations of up to **35% in content development cycles**. [McKinsey's analysis](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) suggests that generative AI could increase marketing function productivity with a value between **5 and 15% of total marketing spending**, while sales productivity could improve by approximately **3 to 5% of current global sales expenditures**.\n\n#### Software Development Acceleration\nMicrosoft's GitHub Copilot study found that software developers using the AI tool completed tasks **56% faster** than those not using it. Internal [McKinsey research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) on software engineering teams showed that those trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced time needed to generate and refactor code. The analysis indicates that direct impact on software engineering productivity could range from **20 to 45% of current annual spending**, primarily through reducing time spent on activities like generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, and root-cause analysis.\n\n#### Research and Development Innovation\nIn R&D applications, generative AI shows potential to deliver productivity with a value ranging from **10 to 15% of overall R&D costs**. Life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation models for generative design, with companies like Entos pairing generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics, accelerating drug and material development processes.\n\n## The Road Ahead: Building Trust and Capability\n\nTransforming AI pilots into success stories requires addressing human and governance factors alongside technology considerations.\n\n### Organizational Readiness as Foundation\n\n[Indicium's analysis](https://indicium.ai/knowledge-hub/blog/generative-ai-for-enterprise-barriers/) of enterprise genAI barriers emphasizes that **66% of organizations were exploring genAI as of late 2023**, with Gartner finding that **55% of businesses were piloting genAI projects**. However, there's a substantial difference between experimenting with genAI and taking full advantage of it across the business.\n\nThe core challenge, according to [Indicium's research](https://indicium.ai/knowledge-hub/blog/generative-ai-for-enterprise-barriers/), lies in data management. Without proper data management tools and processes, enterprises struggle to determine which genAI use cases to target because they don't know if they have the right data—and the right data governance and quality management controls—to enable their considered use cases.\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n[Business Plus AI's strategy framework](https://www.businessplusai.com/blog/ai-strategy-framework-how-to-choose-the-right-solution-for-your-business) identifies several key elements for successful implementation:\n\n#### Governance and Infrastructure Investment\nOrganizations must invest in scalable infrastructure solutions, such as cloud computing, to meet generative AI's computational demands while ensuring flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Implementing governance frameworks that address data privacy, bias mitigation, and transparency is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring responsible AI use.\n\n#### Change Management and Training\n[Panorama Consulting's research](https://www.panorama-consulting.com/generative-ai-adoption-challenges/) found that **60% of employees** may resist AI implementation due to fears of job displacement or lack of understanding. Effective change management strategies are essential, including training programs and stakeholder engagement to promote positive attitudes toward AI adoption.\n\n#### Phased Implementation Strategy\nThe most successful organizations adopt a \"start small, scale smart\" approach, beginning with pilot projects in low-risk, high-impact areas that demonstrate clear business value. This builds internal confidence and expertise before attempting broader implementations.\n\n#### Partnership Over Internal Development\nThe [MIT research](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) revealed that companies purchasing specialized AI solutions report significantly higher success rates than those attempting full internal builds. This finding suggests that strategic partnerships with AI technology providers often deliver better results than solo development efforts.\n\n## Industry-Specific Impact and Applications\n\n[McKinsey's analysis](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) reveals that generative AI's impact varies significantly across industries, with potential annual value generation of **$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion** across the 63 use cases analyzed.\n\n#### Banking and Financial Services\nThe banking industry could see value equal to an additional **$200 billion to $340 billion annually** if generative AI use cases were fully implemented. This represents productivity increases of **2.8 to 4.7% of the industry's annual revenues**. The technology enhances areas like risk management reporting, regulatory monitoring, and customer interactions.\n\n#### Retail and Consumer Goods\nRetail and consumer packaged goods industries show potential for **$400 billion to $660 billion annually** in additional value, representing productivity improvements of **1.2 to 2.0% of annual revenues**. Applications include personalized customer experiences, supply chain optimization, and enhanced product development processes.\n\n#### Technology and Software\nHigh-tech companies benefit primarily from generative AI's ability to increase speed and efficiency of software development, with potential impacts on the entire software value chain through improved code quality and enhanced IT architecture.\n\n## Final Thoughts: The Competitive Imperative\n\nSo, what if generative AI was successfully integrated into your business? The answer is a multi-layered transformation impacting speed, creativity, and cost-efficiency across core operations. Research shows that AI leaders achieve **1.5x higher revenue growth** and **1.6x greater shareholder returns** than laggards, while organizations that establish strong AI foundations achieve positive ROI **45% faster** than competitors.\n\nHowever, [McKinsey's research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) emphasizes that realizing generative AI's full benefits will take time, requiring leaders to address considerable challenges including managing inherent risks, determining necessary workforce skills and capabilities, and rethinking core business processes.\n\nThe journey is challenging, with many pitfalls along the way, but businesses that thoughtfully incorporate generative AI through strategic, data-driven planning reap significant competitive advantages. The technology represents not just a fleeting trend but a powerful asset that, when wisely harnessed through readiness assessment and strategic implementation, can unlock transformative business potential.\n\nThe question remains: are you ready to take that first strategic step, armed with the understanding that success requires more than just technology adoption—it demands organizational transformation, strategic thinking, and a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation?\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1.

What does that actually mean for companies navigating this new technology frontier? What challenges are holding them back, and what drives those who embrace it? Most intriguingly, where has generative AI proven its worth in transforming workflows and outcomes?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-rocky-road-to-ai-adoption\">A Rocky Road to AI Adoption\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The promise of generative AI is nothing short of revolutionary. It can create content, automate customer service, accelerate software development, and unlock insights from mountains of data. Yet, despite the hype, the reality of enterprise adoption tells a sobering story.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A 2025 \u003Ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\">MIT study, \u003Cem>The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025\u003C/em>\u003C/a> revealed that a staggering \u003Cstrong>95% of enterprise generative AI pilot projects fail to deliver measurable business impact or ROI\u003C/strong>. The study, based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and analysis of 300 public AI deployments, found that the core issue isn’t the quality of AI models, but rather a “learning gap” between tools and organizations. The research showed that more than half of generative AI budgets focus on sales and marketing tools, yet the biggest ROI comes from back-office automation—eliminating business process outsourcing and operational costs. This misalignment means companies are underinvesting in areas where AI could deliver substantial cost savings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-knowledge-barrier\">The Knowledge Barrier\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The biggest obstacle is knowledge — or rather, the lack of it. Research from the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/why-companies-arent-using-generative-ai/\">AI Accelerator Institute’s 2025 Generative AI Report\u003C/a> found that \u003Cstrong>46.2% of companies cite lack of understanding\u003C/strong> of generative AI capabilities as the primary reason for avoiding implementation. This knowledge gap manifests in two critical ways: companies either underestimate AI’s potential, missing valuable opportunities, or overestimate its capabilities, leading to disappointment when results don’t match inflated expectations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Many organizations face challenges in aligning AI’s vast potential with real business needs. The study revealed that understanding exactly how generative AI models work, how to train them effectively, and how to correctly integrate and derive value from them requires substantial expertise in machine learning principles—expertise that many organizations simply don’t possess internally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"data-privacy-and-trust\">Data Privacy and Trust\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Data privacy concerns represent a critical implementation barrier. The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/why-companies-arent-using-generative-ai/\">AI Accelerator Institute study\u003C/a> found that \u003Cstrong>30.8% of enterprises identify compliance and data security risks\u003C/strong> as a major obstacle, particularly in regulated sectors like healthcare and finance where inadvertent data exposure through AI model use poses significant risks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Beyond privacy, trust remains elusive. \u003Cstrong>27.2% of non-adopters don’t trust generative AI\u003C/strong> due to its unpredictable nature and tendency to produce inconsistent results. This lack of confidence is particularly problematic in business-critical applications where accuracy and reliability are paramount. The concern stems from generative AI’s known tendency to make mistakes or produce results that deviate from intended outcomes, making it difficult for companies to fully rely on it for critical decisions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"integration-and-cost-complexities\">Integration and Cost Complexities\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Legacy systems create substantial integration challenges. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.panorama-consulting.com/generative-ai-adoption-challenges/\">Panorama Consulting’s 2024 analysis\u003C/a> of generative AI adoption challenges found that many organizations struggle with data silos, inconsistent data formats, and incomplete datasets that hinder AI model performance. Integrating data from disparate sources into formats suitable for AI training proves daunting for most enterprises.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The computational demands are equally formidable. Generative AI models require substantial processing power and storage capacity, often straining existing IT infrastructure and necessitating significant technology investments. Costs escalate quickly beyond initial implementation—ongoing maintenance, security protocols, and specialized talent acquisition add layers of expense. Industry estimates place complex generative AI solutions at costs ranging from $500,000 to several million dollars, depending on scale and customization requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why-some-choose-to-embrace-generative-ai\">Why Some Choose to Embrace Generative AI\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Despite formidable hurdles, organizations that strategically adopt generative AI are seeing meaningful results.

However, they are not without their limitations, particularly when it comes to **hallucinations**—the phenomenon where a model generates information that is plausible-sounding but factually incorrect. In this blog, we'll explore how **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** can help address these limitations, implement it effectively, and understand its architecture, benefits, and challenges.\n![Google Gemini Hallucinating](/google.png)\n\n## Understanding Hallucinations in LLMs\n\nLLMs can sometimes create outputs that sound accurate but are entirely fabricated. For example, if you ask a model about a specific historical event, it might confidently present incorrect details. This limitation can severely affect the reliability of AI applications, especially in critical fields like healthcare and finance.\n\n## Techniques to Tackle Hallucinations\n\nTo mitigate these hallucinations, several techniques can be employed, including:\n\n- **Retrieval Mechanisms**: Implementing a retrieval component that fetches verified data from external sources can significantly enhance the accuracy of LLM outputs.\n- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting model parameters with domain-specific data can help tailor the model's outputs to your needs.\n- **User Feedback Loops**: Incorporating user corrections can provide models with valuable learning opportunities.\n\n## Introduction to RAG\n\n**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an innovative approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods with the generative capabilities of LLMs. By leveraging a knowledge base during the generation process, RAG improves the relevance and accuracy of AI responses.\n\n## RAG Architecture\n\nThe architecture of a RAG system typically consists of:\n\n1. **Retriever**: This component searches a knowledge base for relevant documents or data based on a user query.\n2. **Generator**: After the retrieval step, the generative model synthesizes an answer using the retrieved information.\n\n![RAG Flow](/rag_workflow.gif)\n\n### Recommended Architectural Framework\n\nAdopting RAG requires a thoughtful architectural approach. The blueprint suggests a framework that seamlessly integrates the retrieval and generative components. This includes robust databases, efficient indexing mechanisms for quick data retrieval, and a generative model that can effectively utilize the retrieved data. Ensuring smooth interoperability between these components is key to harnessing the full potential of RAG.\n\nComponents required in a RAG architecture:\n\n1. **Knowledge Base:** Think of this as RAG's library, filled with all sorts of information from documents, databases, or even APIs. It's like a treasure trove of knowledge for RAG to use.\n2. **User Query:** This is where you come in. You ask a question or make a request, and RAG starts its magic.\n3. **Retrieval Model:**\n   - **Embedding Model:** This part turns the text from your question and the information in the knowledge base into numbers. It's like translating languages, but instead, it translates words into a form that the system can understand and compare.\n   - **Search Engine:** Armed with these numerical translations, RAG then searches through its library to find the most relevant information. It's like having a super-efficient librarian at your service.\n4. **Generation Model:**\n   - **Large Language Model (LLM):** This is where RAG gets creative. It uses advanced text generation models (think of them as super-smart writing tools) like GPT-3 to craft a response that's both informative and easy to understand.\n5. **Integration and Orchestration:**\n   - **Prompt Engineering:** This is a bit like scriptwriting for RAG. It takes the information found and mixes it with your original question to set the scene for the LLM.\n   - **Model Serving:** This is the backstage crew, making sure RAG gets your question and sends back the right answer.\n6. **Extra Bits:**\n   - **Monitoring and Logging:** Keeps an eye on RAG to make sure it's doing its job right.\n   - **User Interface:** This is where you interact with RAG, like in a chatbot or search engine.\n\nA key component of the architecture is the Vector Database. It is used to store high-dimensional embeddings of text documents. Its primary role is to enable fast and efficient retrieval of information that is semantically similar to a given query. This retrieval is crucial for the RAG model to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. The vector database ensures scalability, speed, and continuous updating of information, enhancing the overall performance of the RAG system.\n\n![RAG Solution Architecture](/rag_solution.png)\n_RAG Solution Architecture_\n\n## Benefits of RAG\n\n- **Cost-effective Training**: RAG requires less computational power and data compared to extensive fine-tuning or training LLM processes.\n\n- **Access to Various Knowledge Sources**: RAG combines internal knowledge with that from external databases, resulting in more accurate answers.\n\n- **Enhanced Scalability**: RAG can handle large datasets and intricate queries, surpassing conventional LLMs limited by their context window size.\n\n## Limitations of RAG\n\n- **Risk of Hallucinations**: RAG can still make errors if the database lacks certain information.\n\n- **Managing Scalability**: Increasing the database size can complicate quick and efficient data retrieval.\n\n- **Potential Biases**: Biases in the retrieval database can influence the responses, necessitating tools to identify and mitigate these biases.\n\n## The Grand Dilemma: RAG vs Fine-Tune\n\nThe debate in Generative AI often revolves around choosing between RAG and fine-tuning LLMs. This choice is influenced by the need for domain-specificity and the rate of data change.\n\nI have put together a table to guide you through the decision-making process:\n\n| Aspect      | Fine-Tuning                                                                                                                                                               | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)                                                                                                                           |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Advantages  | - Mitigates knowledge gaps with updated, specific data.\u003Cbr>- Cost-effective compared to full model retraining.\u003Cbr>- Suitable for training on private or specialized data. | - Provides near-real-time data updates.\u003Cbr>- Enhances transparency with source citations.\u003Cbr>- Offers better data access control and personalization.          |\n| Challenges  | - Struggles with frequent data updates.\u003Cbr>- Lacks clear traceability to original data sources.\u003Cbr>- Potential for inaccurate information.                                | - Relies heavily on the efficiency of the search system.\u003Cbr>- Limited in context size provided to LLMs.\u003Cbr>- Possible over-reliance may curb model creativity. |\n| Application | - Best for stable, less sensitive data.                                                                                                                                   | - Ideal for scenarios requiring real-time data relevance and flexibility.                                                                                      |\n\nBlending fine-tuning and RAG could leverage their respective strengths, using fine-tuning for stable, less sensitive data, and RAG for real-time data relevance and flexibility. This combination could offer a comprehensive solution in advanced Generative AI applications.\n\nFrom my hands-on experience, it's clear: around 60% of current use cases are swiftly embracing the RAG approach, marking a transformative shift in practical AI application.\n\n## Implementation Guide for RAG\n\n### 1. Setting Up Your RAG Environment\n\nBefore diving into implementation, let's set up a basic environment. For this guide, we'll support both **OpenAI** and **Ollama**:\n\n```bash\npip install langchain chromadb openai tiktoken ollama\n```\n\n### 2. Import the Necessary Components\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI, Ollama\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\n```\n\n### 3. Set Up OpenAI API Key\n\nTo use OpenAI, ensure you have an API key set in your environment:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"your-api-key-here\"\n```\n\n### 4. Initialize Ollama Model\n\nFor Ollama, no API key is required. You can initialize the model directly:\n\n```python\nollama_llm = Ollama(model=\"llama2\")\n```\n\n### 5. Preparing Your Data\n\nOne of the most crucial steps in RAG is properly preparing your data. Here's an example of how to process a text document:\n\n```python\nwith open('your_document.txt', 'r') as file:\n    raw_text = file.read()\n\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ntexts = text_splitter.split_text(raw_text)\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\ndocsearch = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{\"source\": str(i)} for i in range(len(texts))]).as_retriever()\n```\n\n### 6. Building Your RAG Pipeline\n\nWhen building your RAG pipeline, you can now use either OpenAI or Ollama.\n\nFor OpenAI:\n\n```python\nqa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=docsearch)\n```\n\nFor Ollama:\n\n```python\nqa_ollama = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=Ollama(model=\"llama2\"), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=docsearch)\n```\n\n### 7. Optimizing Retrieval\n\nRetrieval quality can make or break your RAG system. Here's a technique to improve retrieval using semantic similarity:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.retrievers import TFIDFRetriever\nfrom langchain.retrievers import EnsembleRetriever\n\n# Create TFIDF retriever\ntfidf_retriever = TFIDFRetriever.from_texts(texts)\n\n# Create ensemble retriever\nensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(\n    retrievers=[docsearch, tfidf_retriever],\n    weights=[0.5, 0.5]\n)\n\n# Use ensemble retriever in your QA chain\nqa_ensemble = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=ensemble_retriever)\n```\n\n### 8. Handling Multi-Modal Data\n\nRAG isn't limited to text. Here's how you might handle image data:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredImageLoader\n\nloader = UnstructuredImageLoader(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\nimage_document = loader.load()[0]\n\n# Now you can include this in your text splitter and embedding process\n```\n\n### 9. Implementing Conversational Memory\n\nFor chatbot-like applications, maintaining context is crucial. Here's how to add memory to your RAG system:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain\n\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", return_messages=True)\n\nqa_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(\n    llm=OpenAI(),\n    retriever=docsearch,\n    memory=memory\n)\n\nresult = qa_chain({\"question\": \"What's the document about?\"})\nprint(result['answer'])\n\n# Follow-up question\nresult = qa_chain({\"question\": \"Can you elaborate on that?\"})\nprint(result['answer'])\n```\n\n### 10. Handling Streaming Responses\n\nFor a more responsive user experience, you might want to stream the LLM's response:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0)\n\nqa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=docsearch)\nqa_chain(\"What is the main topic of this document?\")\n```\n\n### 11. Monitoring and Logging\n\nImplementing proper monitoring is crucial for maintaining and improving your RAG system:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom langchain.callbacks import FileCallbackHandler\n\nlogging.basicConfig(filename='rag_logs.log', level=logging.INFO)\nfile_handler = FileCallbackHandler(\"langchain.log\")\n\nllm = OpenAI(callbacks=[file_handler])\nqa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=docsearch)\n\ntry:\n    result = qa_chain(\"What is the main topic of this document?\")\n    logging.info(f\"Query processed successfully. Result: {result['result']}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logging.error(f\"Error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n```\n\n### 12. Handling Failures Gracefully\n\nHere's a simple way to handle failures:\n\n```python\ndef safe_qa(query):\n    try:\n        result = qa_chain({\"query\": query})\n        return result['result']\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Error processing query '{query}': {str(e)}\")\n        return \"I'm sorry, I couldn't process that query. Could you try rephrasing it?\"\n\nprint(safe_qa(\"What is the meaning of life?\"))\n```\n\n### 13. Continuous Learning and Improvement\n\nTo keep your RAG system up-to-date, implement a feedback loop:\n\n```python\ndef update_knowledge_base(query, answer, feedback):\n    if feedback == \"correct\":\n        new_text = f\"Q: {query}\\nA: {answer}\"\n        texts.append(new_text)\n        docsearch.add_texts([new_text])\n        logging.info(f\"Added new knowledge: {new_text}\")\n    elif feedback == \"incorrect\":\n        logging.info(f\"Incorrect answer logged for query: {query}\")\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy implementing these practical techniques, you can build a robust, responsive, and continually improving RAG system. The key to a successful RAG implementation lies in ongoing refinement and adaptation to your specific use case and data. Whether you're reducing hallucinations or building smarter, data-driven AI systems, RAG is a powerful tool to explore.","posts/retrieval-augmented-generation-guide.md","1ea84e9f5a932172",{"html":197,"metadata":198},"\u003Cp>In the world of AI, \u003Cstrong>Large Language Models (LLMs)\u003C/strong> have shown incredible promise.

For me, that place was COLAB.\n\nIn a previous blog post, I briefly mentioned COLAB while talking about communication skills. But honestly, a footnote doesn't do it justice. This initiative wasn't just a side project during my undergrad years — it was a turning point. It shaped how I think, how I work, and even how I show up in professional spaces like IBM today.\n\n## Growth in Action\n\nCOLAB is a research and learning space at FAST NUCES Peshawar. It was launched in 2017 by Dr. Mohammad Nauman — a name that comes up often in my story for good reason. His vision was clear and refreshingly simple: build a space where students from different academic years could come together, share ideas, and grow — not through rigid structures, but through curiosity and collaboration.\n\nThere were no exams. No grades. No \"outcomes.\" Just one requirement: be present.\n\nEach week, students would share what they were working on. These presentations — casual and often impromptu — created a ripple effect of knowledge-sharing. A first-year student could learn Linux tricks from a senior; a third-semester coder could get feedback on a web app from someone who had built something similar last month. It was fluid, honest, and surprisingly effective.\n\nI'll never forget my first presentation. I was nervous, underprepared, and honestly? It was a mess. But no one laughed. No one dismissed me. Instead, I got questions, suggestions, and a reason to do better next time.\n\nAnd I did.\n\nWeek after week, I presented. Slowly, that shaky voice became steadier. I went from barely managing 5-minute talks to confidently speaking in front of 100+ people. That kind of growth doesn't come from textbooks — it comes from being part of a community that expects your best and supports you on the way there.\n\nBy the end of our second semester, we were already building web apps. Linux became second nature — and yes, I'll say it: if you're still clinging to Windows and calling yourself a developer... we need to talk 😄.\n\nBy our fourth and fifth semesters, we were exploring cloud computing, DevOps pipelines, and functional programming — way ahead of the formal curriculum. We weren't just learning; we were applying.\n\nWe even hosted workshops on DevOps and web development. And these weren't senior projects — they were led by students in their fourth semester. That's the kind of confidence COLAB instilled in us.\n\n![Student Presenting](/colab-presentation.jpeg)  \n*A student presenting in a COLAB session.*\n\n## The Ripple Effect\n\nThe results spoke for themselves. Many of us started freelancing or working part-time while still in university. Some internships turned into long-term jobs. Others who weren't part of COLAB saw what we were doing, got inspired, and started learning and applying the same skills on their own — even though they never actually joined the space.\n\nBy the time graduation rolled around, about 90% of our batch already had job offers in hand. That stat alone is a testament to what's possible when learning is driven by passion rather than pressure.\n\n## Why COLAB Still Matters\n\nFast forward to my time at IBM, and I started seeing echoes of COLAB in the professional world. Agile teams, peer learning, internal communities — these concepts are gaining ground in global organizations. And it's not just a trend. It works.\n\nCOLAB wasn't a one-off experiment. It was a living model of how freedom, collaboration, and purpose can lead to powerful outcomes. And I truly believe that if more institutions and companies adopted this mindset, they'd unlock the same magic.\n\n\n## A Lesson Worth Sharing\n\nIf there's one thing COLAB taught me, it's this: when the right people come together with the right intent, incredible things can happen. It didn't require fancy labs or big budgets. It just needed trust, time, and the willingness to learn — together.\n\nAnd maybe that's the most important lesson of all. Whether you're a student, a team lead, or just someone trying to get better at what you do — seek out (or create) your own COLAB. The results might surprise you.\n\n![Celebration](/team-celebration.jpg)  \n*A group photo after System Administration Workshop on GitHub Local Hackday in 2018*","posts/how-colab-transformed-my-journey.md","e5d3aa40deb08ace",{"html":286,"metadata":287},"\u003Cp>We’ve all had those moments — a spark, an unexpected encounter, or a place that quietly changes the trajectory of your life.

Someone on the team said the magic words:\n\n> “Dude, just use LangChain. It does everything.”\n\nYou nodded. You installed it. You wrapped everything in chains. You sprinkled in some memory, an agent, and maybe three different RAG pipelines.\n\nYou shipped a demo in a weekend. Your boss said, “This is incredible.” Investors said, “You’re moving fast.” For about a month, you felt like a genius.\n\nThen… reality.\n\n- A simple change to one prompt breaks three unrelated chains.\n- Nobody can say which version of a prompt is actually live in production.\n- Your “Q&A over docs” feature is now seven nested components and one mysterious callback.\n- The logs look like a conspiracy theorist’s string map.\n\nSuddenly, you’re not asking, “How can we build this?” You’re asking:\n\n> “How the hell do we _maintain_ this?”\n\nWelcome to life **after** LangChain.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Before We Roast It: What LangChain Actually Got Right\n\nLet's be fair. LangChain is not \"bad.\" It's doing exactly what early-stage frameworks do: it makes you feel powerful, helps you ship fast, and quietly sets you up for a massive refactor later.\n\nIt _is_ genuinely great at:\n\n- **Prototyping at warp speed:** You get from idea to demo stupidly fast. Chains, tools, memory, agents—the whole buffet.\n- **Ecosystem glue:** It talks to half the tools under the sun so you don't have to write every integration from scratch.\n- **Shared vocabulary:** Your team can say \"chains,\" \"tools,\" \"agents,\" and everyone is roughly on the same page.\n\nThe mistake isn't _starting_ with LangChain.\n\nThe mistake is pretending it's a permanent architecture decision.\n\nYou wouldn't run your whole company on a Jupyter notebook.\n\nBut you did the spiritual equivalent with your LLM orchestration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Where the Pain Actually Comes From\n\nIt’s tempting to say everything is on fire and it’s all LangChain’s fault.\n\nBut if you're being honest, there are two different villains here:\n\n1. **LLMs are inherently chaotic**\n\n   - Multi-step workflows are harder than “call API, get response.”\n   - RAG is three disciplines in a trench coat: data engineering + search + modeling.\n   - Agents are probabilistic chaos with a UX.\n\n2. **Frameworks add their own special flavor of pain**\n\n   - Abstractions hide what's really happening.\n   - Prompts are glued to orchestration logic.\n   - “Magic” behavior that looked fun in the docs is now biting you in production.\n\nLife after LangChain isn't a breakup.\n\nIt's growing up and admitting:\n\n> \"We need to design a stack for what we actually do, not for what the framework's README thinks we do.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. The Sniff Test: Have You Outgrown LangChain?\n\nIf you’re a consultant, tech lead, or the unofficial “AI person” on the team, use this as a quick diagnostic.\n\nYou've outgrown \"cool framework\" land if:\n\n- **Can't answer which prompt is live** - \"Which prompt is live in production right now?\"\n- **Afraid to touch a chain** - \"Last time we changed that, onboarding broke.\"\n- **Every bug investigation is recursive** - \"Okay, which chain of chains of callbacks is this going through?\"\n\n- Your RAG architecture diagram looks like it belongs on a crime investigation wall.\n\nIf any of that feels uncomfortably familiar, congrats.\n\nYou've graduated from \"prototype hacking\" to **system design**—whether you meant to or not.\n\nNow the question becomes:\n\n> \"What are we _actually_ spending our time doing?\"\n\nBecause that—not whatever is trending on Twitter—should dictate your stack.\n\n---\n\n### 4. If Your Whole Week Is Just You vs. Prompts\n\nSome teams live in **prompt purgatory**.\n\nEvery sprint looks like:\n\n- “Tweak the prompt.”\n- “Compare the outputs.”\n- “Revert the prompt.”\n- “Why is staging different from prod?”\n- “Who edited this and why???”\n\nWith LangChain, prompts often end up:\n\n- Buried in chain configs,\n- Mixed with business logic,\n- \"Versioned\" in Slack threads and people's memories.\n\nIf 70–80% of your week is prompt design, you don't need a chain framework.\n\nYou need a **prompt workflow**.\n\n#### Do This Instead: Go Prompt-First\n\nYour stack should treat prompts like first-class citizens:\n\n- Explicit, versioned, testable.\n- Easy to compare across models.\n- Easy to roll back when you ship something cursed.\n\nHere are tools designed specifically for that:\n\n- **Vellum AI** - Built for prompt testing, versioning, and comparison. Great when you need to say: _\"This prompt+model config is 12% better on our eval set.\"_\n- **Mirascope** - Keeps prompts in your code, but makes them readable and testable. Less \"magic chain behavior,\" more \"I can diff this like normal code.\"\n- **Guidance** - Lets you define patterns and constraints for model outputs. Very useful when you care about structured responses (JSON, templated text, etc.).\n\nLangChain can still provide some glue if you want.\n\nBut the **center of gravity** should be: prompts + evaluation, not \"bigger, cooler chains.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. If Your Real Problem Is: “We Have No Idea What’s Going On”\n\nOther teams aren't dying from prompts.\n\nThey're dying from **opacity**.\n\nYou hear:\n\n- **Prod is weird but works locally** - \"Prod is acting weird but it works on my laptop.\"\n- **Can't measure change impact** - \"We changed the model and now some flows are better and some are worse, but we can't say which.\"\n- **Can't replay user session** - \"Can we see exactly what the user saw here?\" → _awkward silence_\n\nThat's not primarily a framework problem.\n\nThat's an **observability and evaluation** problem.\n\n#### Do This Instead: Go Debug/Eval-First\n\nAs a product team, you want:\n\n- Full traces of each request, step by step.\n- The ability to replay real traffic on new prompts/models.\n- Basic evaluation to say, “This deploy helped here and hurt there.”\n\nTools to look at:\n\n- **Galileo** - Treats your LLM app like a real system with evaluation, error analysis, and slices. Helps you find things like, \"This specific type of query regressed 30%.\"\n- **Mirascope** (yes, again) - Explicit model calls and clear structure make tracing and testing far easier.\n\nLangChain's own tracing is better than nothing, but if your main problem is \"we're flying blind,\" you'll get more leverage from **better eval + simpler orchestration** than from layering on more framework features.\n\n---\n\n### 6. If Your Agents Are Basically Goblins With API Keys\n\nLet’s talk about agents.\n\nIn demos, they look brilliant.\n\nIn production, your logs say:\n\n- **Tool called too many times** - \"Why did it call this tool 14 times?\"\n- **Agent loops forever** - \"Why is it stuck in a loop?\"\n- **Agent did something forbidden** - \"Who told it it was allowed to do _that_?\"\n\nIf your current agent story is \"we pray and we log,\" that's not architecture.\n\nThat's ritual.\n\n#### Do This Instead: Treat Agents Like Systems, Not Party Tricks\n\nFor real products, agents need:\n\n- **Roles** - Planner vs executor vs reviewer, not a single chaotic brain\n- **Structure** - Plans, graphs, or workflows, not free-form while-loops\n- **Guardrails** - Hard limits on what they can and cannot do\n\nStack ideas:\n\n- **MetaGPT** - Multi-agent with clearly defined roles (PM, engineer, reviewer). Feels closer to a designed process than a single chaotic brain.\n- **Grip Tape** - Focuses on tasks, dependencies, and explicit planning. You can see and adjust the plan instead of begging the agent to \"behave.\"\n- **AutoGPT / AgentGPT** - Great Playgrounds to experiment with autonomy. But please stop treating them like foundations for mission-critical workflows.\n\nWhether you express this via LangChain, LangGraph, or something else is secondary.\n\nThe big shift is mental:\n\n> Agents should be **systems with plans**, not clever loops you hope behave.\n\n---\n\n### 7. If Your Product Is Basically “Chat With Your Data” (RAG)\n\nLet’s be honest: half of the “AI startups” right now are some version of:\n\n> “Ask questions about your documents/data/wiki/etc.”\n\nThat's **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. If that's your core product and your current setup is:\n\n- 4 document loaders\n- 3 text splitters\n- 2 retrievers\n- 1 chain\n- Several callbacks\n\n…it’s probably time to go **data-first** instead of **framework-first**.\n\n#### Do This Instead: Go RAG/Data-First\n\nYou want a stack that’s built around:\n\n- How you **ingest and index** data.\n- How you **query** that index.\n- How you **generate** answers from retrieved context.\n\nTools that fit that mindset:\n\n- **LlamaIndex** - Strong abstractions for ingestion, indexing, and querying. You think in terms of data and indexes, not just chains.\n- **Haystack** - Mature pipelines for search and question answering. Great when search quality and retrieval behavior are central.\n- **Flowise AI** - Visual builder that lets you prototype and show flows without 10 Python files. Surprisingly good for communicating architecture to non-engineers.\n\nIn many RAG-heavy products, LangChain either becomes a thin wrapper—or fades away entirely—once a data-centric stack is in place.\n\n---\n\n### 8. If You Need Both Search _and_ Clean JSON\n\nAnother very common pattern:\n\nYou want **fast semantic search** across your data, **and** you need clean, structured outputs (JSON, tables, fields) that plug directly into downstream logic.\n\nLangChain can absolutely wire this up, but you don't have to go full-framework for this.\n\n#### Do This Instead: Retrieval + Structure, Sans Framework\n\nBuild like this:\n\n- **Vector search layer** - **Milvus** or **Weaviate** for large-scale semantic search, or **Amazon Kendra** if deep in AWS + enterprise search world\n- **Structured generation layer** - **Instructor** to keep your JSON and typed outputs sane\n\nThen:\n\n- Talk to your vector DB directly via its client.\n- Use Instructor to coerce the LLM into returning well-typed JSON.\n- Keep the orchestration layer thin, explicit, and boring.\n\nYou don't get \"framework magic.\"\n\nYou get predictable behavior and debuggable code.\n\n---\n\n### 9. If You’re Secretly Done With Frameworks\n\nAt some point, a certain kind of engineer on the team snaps and says:\n\n> “I’m tired of yolo-ing inside someone else’s abstraction layer. Let’s just use the APIs.”\n\nThis path is underrated.\n\n#### Do This Instead: Go Thin-Wrapper / No-Framework\n\nYour stack becomes:\n\n- **Thin, boring wrappers** around **OpenAI / Anthropic / Hugging Face** APIs and your vector DB of choice\n- **Tiny internal library** for retries/error handling, logging/telemetry, and simple evaluation / A/B testing\n\nPros:\n\n- You see everything.\n- Onboarding is easier (“here’s our `llm_client` module`).\n- You refactor based on your needs, not framework releases.\n\nCons:\n\n- You own the glue.\n- If you’re sloppy, you’ll accidentally reinvent a worse framework.\n\nThis works best when:\n\n- You have 1–3 well-defined LLM use cases, and\n- At least one engineer likes designing small internal tools.\n\n---\n\n### 10. If Enterprise Showed Up and Killed the Vibes\n\nIf you’re at a larger org, the conversation changes hard.Now you hear:\n\n- “Where does the data go?”\n- “How do we audit this?”\n- “What’s our AI platform strategy?”\n\nAt that point, the real decision is:\n\n> \"Which **managed AI platform** are we building on?\"\n\nNot: \"LangChain vs something else.\"\n\nOptions:\n\n- **IBM watsonx** - Heavy on governance, lineage, and risk management\n- **Amazon Bedrock** - Managed access to multiple models with AWS-native security and monitoring\n- **Azure AI / SageMaker JumpStart** - Deep integration with your existing cloud, identity, and MLOps stack\n\nIn this world, LangChain (or any orchestration framework) is just a supporting actor.\n\nThe platform, security, and compliance story take center stage.\n\n---\n\n### 11. So… How Do You Actually Fix This?\n\n“Life after LangChain” doesn’t mean:\n\n- “LangChain is trash, uninstall it,” or\n- “Here’s the new silver bullet framework to bet the company on.”\n\nIt means:\n\n1. **Admit you built a house with prototyping tools.**  \n   That’s fine. Everyone does. Just don’t pretend it’s a skyscraper.\n\n2. **Figure out your _real_ job.**\n\n   - Are you mostly designing prompts?\n   - Mostly wrangling data and retrieval?\n   - Mostly trying to debug behavior?\n   - Mostly dealing with governance and risk?\n\n3. **Choose tools that match that reality.**  \n   Not because a framework told you to, but because your product demands it.\n\nUse LangChain for what it is:\n\nAn excellent **on-ramp**.\n\nThen, when the pain starts to feel familiar and constant, treat it as a signal:\n\n> “Okay. Time to graduate from magic to architecture.”\n\nFrameworks will churn.\n\nHype will move on.\n\nThe teams that win will be the ones that understand the **systems** they're building—not just the libraries they imported.\n\nAnd if your current stack diagram looks like modern art?\n\nThat's not a failure.\n\nThat’s just your sign that it’s time for version two.","posts/you-built-everything-on-langchain-heres-how-to-fix-that.md","6ff5b4b684951045",{"html":343,"metadata":344},"\u003Cp>Let me guess how this went.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You wanted to build an AI feature that would blow everyone’s mind.

You Won't. Here's What Changed.","The 2019 playbook is dead. AI killed it. Here's what fresh grads need to do instead of grinding DSA and praying for callbacks.","Dec 31 2025",[18,57,59,440,441],"job-hunting","students","I spent six months grinding.\n\nOOP. Data structures. Algorithms. Operating systems. Then LeetCode—mediums, hards, the whole gauntlet. I landed a job.\n\nThat was a few years ago.\n\nIf you're doing the same thing in 2026, you're fighting the last war.\n\nAnd you're going to lose.\n\n## The Playbook That Worked (Past Tense)\n\nHere's what the script used to be:\n\n1. Get a CS degree (or self-teach the fundamentals)\n2. Grind LeetCode until you can invert a binary tree in your sleep\n3. Pass the technical interview\n4. Collect offers\n\nIt worked because companies needed warm bodies who could code. The bar was \"can you write a working solution to this contrived algorithm problem in 45 minutes?\"\n\nIf you could, you were in.\n\nThe market was hot. Remote work exploded. Companies were desperate. You could be the weird basement-dwelling nerd with zero soft skills and still get multiple offers because *you could code*.\n\nThat world is gone.\n\n## What Killed It\n\nAI.\n\nSpecifically: AI democratized technical skills.\n\nChatGPT can pass LeetCode mediums. Claude can explain operating system concepts better than most TAs. Cursor can scaffold a full-stack app in minutes.\n\nYour six-month grind? It's now table stakes, not differentiation.\n\nThe companies that used to hire you for \"can you code?\" are now asking \"okay, but what *else* do you bring?\"\n\nAnd if your answer is \"uh… I'm really good at LeetCode?\" you're cooked.\n\n## What Fresh Grads Are Getting Wrong\n\n### Mistake 1: Thinking a CS Degree = Job Security\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nA degree proves you survived four years of academic hazing. It doesn't prove you can ship software, communicate with a team, or add value in a world where AI can generate boilerplate faster than you can type `import`.\n\nThe market is flooded with CS grads who all have the same resume:\n- \"Proficient in Python, Java, C++\"\n- \"Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms\"\n- \"Completed [generic capstone project]\"\n\nYou're not special. You're one of 10,000 identical resumes in a stack.\n\n### Mistake 2: Optimizing for Technical Interviews Instead of Demonstrable Value\n\nLeetCode is a game. You're grinding it because you think it's the gatekeeper.\n\nBut here's the thing: companies are starting to realize that \"can solve LeetCode hards\" ≠ \"can build and ship features.\"\n\nWhat actually matters:\n- **Can you scope a problem?** (Not just solve it—*define* it.)\n- **Can you ship something real?** (GitHub portfolio > LeetCode rank.)\n- **Can you explain your decisions?** (Why this architecture? Why this tradeoff?)\n\nIf your entire job-hunting strategy is \"grind LeetCode, hope for callbacks,\" you're optimizing for a test that's becoming less relevant.\n\n### Mistake 3: Ignoring Soft Skills Because \"I'm Technical\"\n\nThis one's brutal, but it's true:\n\n**AI has made your technical skills less valuable. Your communication skills are now the moat.**\n\nCompanies used to tolerate the brilliant-but-difficult engineer because they *needed* the technical firepower.\n\nNow? AI can write the code. What AI *can't* do is:\n- Align stakeholders on what to build\n- Communicate technical tradeoffs to non-technical people\n- Navigate team dynamics and culture\n- Think strategically about product direction\n\nIf you can't do those things, you're competing with a $20/month ChatGPT subscription.\n\nAnd you're losing.\n\n## What You Should Do Instead\n\n### 1. Build in Public. Ship Real Projects.\n\nStop treating your GitHub like a graveyard of half-finished tutorials.\n\nBuild something real. Ship it. Put it in front of users (even if \"users\" = your friends).\n\nExamples:\n- A CLI tool that solves a problem you actually have\n- A side project with a real deployment (not just `localhost:3000`)\n- An open-source contribution (even a small one)\n\nThe goal: prove you can *define, scope, and deliver*—not just code.\n\nBonus points if you use **Spec-Driven Development** (shameless plug for my [previous post](https://essayyzed.github.io/post/stop-vibe-coding-sdd/)) to show you can plan before you build.\n\n### 2. Learn to Communicate Technical Decisions\n\n\"I built X\" is not impressive.\n\n\"I built X because Y, and here's the impact\" is.\n\nPractice:\n- Writing design docs (even for personal projects)\n- Explaining tradeoffs (\"I chose Postgres over MongoDB because...\")\n- Turning technical work into business value (\"This reduced load time by 40%, which improved user retention\")\n\nIf you can't explain *why* you made a decision, you're just a code monkey. And AI is a cheaper code monkey.\n\n### 3. Understand Fundamentals, Not Frameworks\n\nHere's a truth bomb from [Carly Taylor's recent post](https://carlytaylor.substack.com/p/getting-a-job-offer-in-2026):\n\n> \"Fundamentals are gravity. And in the end, gravity wins.\"\n\nFrameworks change every six months. Fundamentals don't.\n\nWhat won't change:\n- How databases work (indexes, transactions, normalization)\n- How networks work (TCP/IP, HTTP, latency)\n- How distributed systems work (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n- How to write maintainable code (separation of concerns, testing, documentation)\n\nIf you're spending more time learning \"the latest React meta\" than understanding how a database query actually executes, you're building on sand.\n\n### 4. Get Comfortable with AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch\n\nAI is not going away. You need to learn to work *with* it, not against it.\n\nBut here's the key: **if you can't explain why the AI-generated code works, you're not adding value.**\n\nUse AI to:\n- Scaffold boilerplate\n- Generate test cases\n- Explain unfamiliar concepts\n\nDon't use AI to:\n- Replace understanding\n- Skip the hard thinking\n- Ship code you can't debug\n\nThe devs who survive are the ones who can *leverage* AI while still understanding what's happening under the hood.\n\n## What Universities Need to Fix (And Fast)\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: **academia is graduating students for a job market that no longer exists.**\n\nUniversities are still teaching like it's 2015. The curriculum hasn't caught up to the reality that AI fundamentally changed what \"being a software engineer\" means.\n\n### What's Broken\n\n**1. Capstone projects are theater, not preparation.**\n\nMost capstone projects are:\n- Built in a vacuum (no real users, no real constraints)\n- Never deployed (localhost doesn't count)\n- Never maintained (ship it, grade it, forget it)\n- Group projects where one person does all the work and everyone gets the same grade\n\nThis teaches students that \"done\" = \"it compiles and passes the rubric.\"\n\nIn the real world, \"done\" = \"it's deployed, monitored, documented, and someone else can maintain it.\"\n\n**2. Communication skills are treated as electives, not requirements.**\n\nYou can graduate with a CS degree without ever:\n- Writing a technical design doc\n- Presenting a technical decision to non-technical stakeholders\n- Explaining a tradeoff in plain English\n- Working cross-functionally with designers, PMs, or business folks\n\nThen students graduate and wonder why they can't get past the behavioral interview.\n\n**3. The curriculum is unbalanced: too much theory, not enough practice.**\n\nDon't get me wrong — algorithms and data structures **are** important. They teach you:\n- How to think about complexity and tradeoffs\n- How to reason about performance\n- Foundational patterns (hash maps, trees, graphs) you'll use everywhere\n\nBut here's the problem: **you can graduate with a CS degree knowing how to implement a red-black tree but not knowing how to debug a production incident.**\n\nStudents spend four years on:\n- Algorithm design and analysis (critical)\n- Data structures (critical)\n- Complexity theory (important)\n- Dynamic programming (useful for interviews, occasionally useful for work)\n\nBut they graduate without knowing:\n- How to debug a production incident\n- How to read a stack trace\n- How to profile performance bottlenecks\n- How to work with legacy code\n- How to make architectural tradeoffs\n- How to deploy and monitor software\n\n**Both matter.** Theory teaches you how to think. Practice teaches you how to ship.\n\nRight now, the balance is 90% theory, 10% practice. It should be closer to 60/40.\n\n**4. AI is treated as a threat, not a tool.**\n\nMost universities are still banning AI tools or treating them like cheating.\n\nMeanwhile, every company expects new hires to be comfortable using AI as part of their workflow.\n\nThe result? Students graduate and have to unlearn the \"AI is cheating\" mindset on day one.\n\n### What Universities Should Do Instead\n\n**1. Make capstone projects real.**\n\n- Require deployment (not just localhost)\n- Require real users (even if it's just 10 people)\n- Require maintenance (students should fix bugs and add features over multiple semesters)\n- Require documentation (READMEs, design docs, runbooks)\n- Grade individually, not as a group\n\nTeach students that shipping software is a process, not a one-time event.\n\n**2. Make communication a core competency.**\n\nAdd required courses on:\n- Technical writing (design docs, RFCs, incident reports)\n- Technical communication (explaining tradeoffs to non-technical audiences)\n- Cross-functional collaboration (working with PMs, designers, business stakeholders)\n\nMake students present their work. Make them defend their decisions. Make them write docs that someone else can actually use.\n\n**3. Balance theory with practice.**\n\nKeep teaching algorithms and data structures — they're foundational.\n\nBut add practical courses on:\n- Debugging and observability (logs, metrics, traces)\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Working with legacy code\n- Architectural tradeoffs (monolith vs microservices, SQL vs NoSQL, etc.)\n- Production operations (CI/CD, monitoring, incident response)\n\nTheory and practice aren't enemies. Students need both.\n\n**4. Integrate AI into the curriculum.**\n\nStop treating AI like cheating. Start teaching students:\n- How to use AI effectively (as a tool, not a crutch)\n- How to evaluate AI-generated code (does it work? is it maintainable? does it meet requirements?)\n- How to add value beyond what AI can do (strategic thinking, communication, systems design)\n\nThe students who graduate knowing how to *leverage* AI will outcompete the ones who were taught to fear it.\n\n**5. Bring in practitioners, not just researchers.**\n\nMost CS professors have never shipped production software. They're brilliant researchers, but they're teaching a curriculum designed for academia, not industry.\n\nBring in adjunct professors who are currently working engineers. Let them teach:\n- Real-world software engineering practices\n- How to navigate ambiguity\n- How to make tradeoffs under constraints\n- How to work on a team\n\nTheory matters. But so does practice.\n\n### The Bottom Line for Universities\n\nYou're graduating students with a 2015 skill set into a 2026 job market.\n\nAnd then you're surprised when they can't find jobs.\n\nThe world changed. Your curriculum didn't.\n\nFix it.\n\n## The Hard Truth: You Have No Leverage\n\nThis is an employer's market.\n\nYou're not negotiating $10k raises. You're not bringing an offer back to your current employer for a counter. You're competing with 500 other fresh grads who have the same degree, the same LeetCode grind, and the same generic resume.\n\nYour job is to be **undeniable**—not just \"qualified.\"\n\nThat means:\n- A portfolio that proves you can ship\n- Communication skills that prove you can work with humans\n- Fundamentals that prove you can adapt when the stack changes\n- Proof that you add value beyond \"I can write code\"\n\n## The New Grind\n\nI got a job by grinding LeetCode.\n\nYou'll get a job by grinding **relevance**.\n\nBuild things. Ship them. Explain them. Prove you can add value in a world where AI can code but can't think strategically, communicate effectively, or navigate ambiguity.\n\nThat's the new bar.\n\nThe old playbook is dead. Adapt or get left behind.\n\n---\n\n**Related:**\n- [Stop Vibe Coding.

Actual timelines can vary significantly depending on the specific technology, company context, and individual use case. Some frameworks (like React) have longer staying power, while others fade quickly. Core logic remains stable, but even fundamental concepts can evolve. Meta-learning skills require continuous refinement as learning methods and tools change.\n\nTo stay relevant, you don’t need more information. You’re already drowning in it. You need a better system for processing the garbage. You need to stop **Vibe Learning** and start **Meta-Learning.**\n\n## 1. Kill the \"Expert\" Ego (The Beginner’s Tax)\n\nThe biggest barrier to learning isn't your IQ; it’s your fear of looking like an idiot.\n\nAs you get more senior, you start feeling a self-imposed pressure to always have the answer. You nod along in meetings when someone mentions a new vector DB you’ve never heard of because you’re afraid that saying \"I don't know\" will tank your billable rate.\n\n**The Shift:** Move from \"Know-it-all\" to \"Learn-it-all.\"  \nA real master isn't the person who has the docs memorized; it’s the person who has a repeatable system for finding the answer while the \"expert\" is still buffering. True seniority begins the moment you’re comfortable saying, *\"I don't know yet, but give me 20 minutes and a terminal.\"*\n\n## 2. Stop \"Vibe Learning\" (The 80/20 Deconstruction)\n\nMost devs \"Vibe Learn\"—they watch YouTube videos at 2x speed, nod their heads, and hope for osmosis. This is the educational equivalent of \"Vibe Coding\" without a spec. It feels like progress, but it produces zero retained value.\n\n**The Strategy:** Deconstruct the skill before you touch a keyboard.  \nMost frameworks are 80% boilerplate and 20% actual innovation. If you’re learning a new language, don't start with \"Advanced Memory Management.\" Focus on the **Critical Path**:  \n* How does it handle state?  \n* How does it talk to an API?  \n* How do I debug it when it inevitably explodes?\n\nMaster the 20% that handles 80% of the production use cases. Ignore the edge cases until they’re actually costing you money.\n\n## 3. The Feynman Filter: Jargon is a Mask for Ignorance\n\nThere is a massive difference between knowing the *name* of a concept and *understanding* it. In consulting, we see this all the time: people using words like \"Idempotency\" or \"Atomic Transactions\" to sound smart while their code is a race-condition nightmare.\n\n**The Test:** Explain the concept to a 12-year-old (or a Product Manager—same thing).  \nIf you can’t explain \"Technical Debt\" or \"The CAP Theorem\" without using three other buzzwords, you don’t understand it. You’re just repeating a script. Simplification isn't \"dumbing it down\"; it’s the highest form of mastery.\n\n## 4. Just-In-Time > Just-In-Case (The 20/80 Rule)\n\nMost devs suffer from \"Just-In-Case\" learning. They bookmark 400 articles on \"Scaling to 100M Users\" while their current app has three active users. By the time you actually need that knowledge, it’ll be outdated.\n\n**The Exit Strategy:** Follow the **20/80 Rule of Consumption.**  \nSpend 20% of your time reading the theory and 80% of your time breaking the implementation. If you spend more than 20% of your time \"studying,\" you're just procrastinating with a highlighter.  \n* **The Loop:** Read for 15 minutes, break the build for 2 hours.  \nThe faster the feedback loop of pain, the deeper the knowledge sticks.\n\n**Note on Foundational Learning:** While JIT learning is crucial for rapid adaptation, some foundational \"Just-In-Case\" learning is necessary for deep expertise. Balance JIT learning with strategic foundational study to build robust knowledge.\n\n## 5. Build a \"Second Brain\" (Because Your First One is Full)\n\nYour brain is a processor, not a hard drive.\n\nIf you find yourself Googling the same regex or the same \"How to center a div\" for the tenth time this year, you’re failing at Meta-Learning. You’re wasting mental cycles on solved problems.\n\n**The Infrastructure:** Use Notion, Obsidian, or a folder of Markdown files.  \nStore your patterns, your \"gotchas,\" and your \"never-do-this-again\" logs. When a challenge arises, you shouldn't be searching your memory; you should be searching your **System.** A senior dev is just a junior dev with a better library of snippets and a shorter path to the solution.\n\n## 6. Leverage Collaborative Learning (Beyond Individual Systems)\n\nWhile personal systems are crucial, don't underestimate the power of collaborative learning. Peer learning, mentorship, and community engagement accelerate your meta-learning journey. Engage with communities, seek mentors, and participate in knowledge-sharing sessions to complement your individual learning systems.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe gap between a \"Legacy Developer\" and a \"High-Value Architect\" is built out of the things you haven't learned yet.\n\nIn a world where AI can write your boilerplate faster than you can type `npm init`, your value isn't in what you *know*. It’s in how fast you can *discard* what you know to learn what’s next.\n\n**The Challenge:**  \nPick one tool you’ve been \"meaning to get to.\" Don't buy a course. Spend 30 minutes deconstructing the **Critical 20%**. Then, go explain it to someone who doesn't care about tech.\n\nIf they get it, you’ve learned it. If they don't, go back to the docs.","posts/meta-learning.md","bba4e6d9057fd585",{"html":518,"metadata":519},"\u003Cp>In the technology world, we obsess over the \u003Cem>what\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>“Should I learn Mojo or stick with Python?”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“Is Tailwind still cool, or are we back to raw CSS because a guy on X said so?”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“Which AWS certification will make my LinkedIn profile look less like a cry for help?”\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: \u003Cstrong>Technical knowledge is a depreciating asset.\u003C/strong> If you aren’t accounting for the “Learning Tax,” you’re effectively running your career into the ground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-developer-depreciation-schedule\">The Developer Depreciation Schedule\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Before you dive into another 40-hour course, look at the ROI of your time:\u003C/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth>Asset Class\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Estimated Half-Life\u003C/th>\u003Cth>The Reality Check\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>JS Frameworks\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>18–24 Months\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>By the time you’re an “expert,” the “Next Big Thing” is in Beta.\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Cloud APIs/SDKs\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>3 Years\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>You’re one “Deprecation Notice” email away from irrelevance.\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Core Logic (SQL, DS&#x26;A)\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>10+ Years\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>The “Old Reliable” that actually pays the mortgage.\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Meta-Learning\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Lifetime\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>The only system that compounds instead of decaying.\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disclaimer:\u003C/strong> These half-life estimates are generalizations based on industry trends.

It's Undefined Behavior.\n\nLLMs don't optimize for correctness. They optimize for plausibility.\n\nSo when your inputs are vague, the model fills the gaps with:\n\n- \"best practices\"\n- invented constraints\n- refactors you didn't request\n- \"helpful improvements\" that silently change behavior\n\nIn other words: you didn't specify reality, so it guessed.\n\n**Spec‑Driven Development (SDD)** is how you stop paying for guessing.\n\n## The Spec‑Driven People\n\nThese are the devs who learned (often the hard way) that \"just start coding\" is fine until it's not.\n\nThey write down:\n\n- what the system should do\n- what it should not do\n- what \"done\" means\n- what risks exist\n- what constraints are non‑negotiable\n\nThen they implement.\n\nWhen AI enters the workflow, these devs don't magically become faster. They become safer. Because the AI is implementing a contract instead of improvising.\n\n## Spec‑Driven Development (SDD), in One Sentence\n\nSDD is a workflow where the **spec is the source of truth**, and code changes are implementations of spec changes.\n\nNot waterfall.\nNot a 40‑page PDF.\nNot \"process theater.\"\n\nJust: define behavior first, then implement.\n\n## \"Okay, cool. Show me receipts.\"\n\nHere's what SDD looks like when it's actually in a repo.\n\nI'm going to use my project **Quilora** as an example (a production-ready RAG app). The important part is not \"RAG.\" It's the _shape of the artifacts_.\n\n### 1) Project Context (a.k.a. the repo's constitution)\n\nIf you don't tell the AI your rules, it will bring its own.\n\nQuilora has a [project_context_doc][project-context] that's concrete. Example excerpts:\n\n```markdown\n## Purpose\n\n**Quilora** (\"Ask your documents anything\") is a production-ready\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application...\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n### Backend\n\n- **Python 3.11+**\n- **Haystack 2.x**\n- **FastAPI**\n- **aisuite**: Unified LLM interface for provider flexibility\n- **Qdrant**: Vector database...\n\n## Project Conventions\n\n### Code Style\n\n- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use Black formatter (line length: 100)\n- **Type hints**: Required for all function signatures\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% code coverage\n\n## Important Constraints\n\n- **LLM Provider Flexibility**: Must support switching between\n  providers ... without code changes\n- **Cost Management**: Implement token tracking and rate limiting\n- **Response Time**: Target \u003C3s for retrieval, streaming for generation\n```\n\nThat's not \"documentation.\" That's **guardrails**.\n\nThis single file prevents the classic AI failure mode:\n\n> \"I didn't know your stack, so I rewrote it into my favorite architecture.\"\n\n### 2) Proposal (scope, goals, non-goals, and success criteria)\n\nA spec-driven change starts by defining _intent_ before implementation.\n\nQuilora's [proposal_doc][proposal] includes goals, non-goals, and measurable criteria. Example excerpts:\n\n```markdown\n## Goals\n\n1. **Document Management**: Upload and index documents (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX)\n   into Qdrant...\n2. **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant document chunks...\n3. **Answer Generation**: Use aisuite to generate responses...\n4. **REST API**: FastAPI endpoints with streaming support...\n5. **Frontend UI**: Vue 3 interface...\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Multi-user authentication (can be added later)\n- Advanced document preprocessing (OCR, table extraction)\n- Fine-tuning LLM models\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Successfully index documents and retrieve relevant chunks with\n  > 0.7 relevance score\n- API response time \u003C3s for retrieval, streaming for generation\n- Docker Compose brings up entire stack ... successfully\n- 80% code coverage with tests\n```\n\nThis is the part vibe coders skip and then spend two weeks arguing in PR reviews about what \"done\" was supposed to mean.\n\n### 3) Tasks (a checklist the AI can't pretend it didn't see)\n\n\"Build X\" is a vibe. A task list is executable.\n\nQuilora's [task_plan][tasks] is long, but notice the shape: it's ordered, checkable, and test-aware. Example excerpts:\n\n```markdown\n## 2. Configuration Management\n\n- [ ] 2.1 Implement settings.py with Pydantic Settings...\n- [ ] 2.2 Add configuration for Qdrant connection...\n- [ ] 2.3 Add configuration for aisuite...\n\n## 7. FastAPI Backend\n\n- [ ] 7.2 Implement health check endpoint (GET /health)\n- [ ] 7.3 Implement document upload endpoint (POST /documents)\n- [ ] 7.6 Implement query endpoint with streaming (POST /query)\n- [ ] 7.10 Write API tests using TestClient\n\n## 9. Vue 3 Frontend\n\n- [ ] 9.8 Add SSE (Server-Sent Events) handling for streaming responses\n- [ ] 9.9 Implement error handling and loading states\n```\n\nThis is how you stop the assistant from going \"done!\" when it's actually \"I coded something and left half the acceptance criteria as an exercise for the reader.\"\n\n## Where OpenSpec Fits (One Implementation of SDD)\n\nSDD is the concept. **OpenSpec** is one implementation that standardizes how these artifacts live in-repo (proposal → tasks → spec deltas → archive).\n\nLearn more at [openspec.dev][openspec-site] and the [OpenSpec GitHub repo][openspec-repo].\n\nOpenSpec doesn't magically make specs good. It just makes it harder to skip them.\n\n## SDD vs TDD vs Design Docs (Quick Reality Check)\n\n- **TDD** proves code behaves correctly (in testable cases).\n- **Design docs** justify architecture decisions.\n- **SDD** defines intended behavior and constraints so implementation (human or AI) has a contract.\n\nThey're not enemies. They're different tools for different failure modes.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIf you're using AI to write code, SDD isn't bureaucracy. It's guardrails.\n\nYou don't wear a seatbelt because you love seatbelts.\nYou wear it because you've seen what happens when you don't.\n\nSpec‑Driven Development is the seatbelt for AI‑assisted development.\n\n[project-context]: https://github.com/essayyzed/quilora-ai/main/openspec/project.md\n[proposal]: https://github.com/essayyzed/quilora-ai/main/openspec/changes/implement-rag-application/proposal.md\n[tasks]: https://github.com//essayyzed/quilora-ai/main/openspec/changes/implement-rag-application/tasks.md\n[openspec-site]: https://openspec.dev/\n[openspec-repo]: https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec","posts/stop-vibe-coding-sdd.md","be90cf9625db2a0b",{"html":560,"metadata":561},"\u003Cp>If your “requirements” live in a Slack thread, two Jira comments, and whatever you typed into an LLM at 1:12 AM…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>…you’re not shipping software.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You’re shipping \u003Cstrong>interpretations of vibes\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then you act surprised when the model “misunderstands” you and rewrites half your codebase because you forgot one tiny constraint like “don’t break auth” or “don’t add dependencies” or “don’t refactor the whole backend because you got inspired.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-problem-isnt-ai-its-undefined-behavior\">The Problem Isn’t AI.

2) Create a Java Project in Eclipse (Maximo 7.6.1 = Java 8)\n\nIn Eclipse:\n\n- **Project Explorer → New → Java Project**\n- Name it something like: `Max761`\n- Set the Java compliance level to **JavaSE-1.8** for Maximo 7.6.1\n\n> If you’re on an older Maximo version (e.g., 7.5), you may see Java 7 mentioned in older guides—but for **7.6.1**, Java 8 is the common target in this workflow.\n\n**Screenshot:** New project creation  \n![Create Java project](/java_custom_max/1.project.png)\n\n---\n\n### 3) Point Eclipse to the correct JRE (WebSphere Java)\n\nMaximo runs on WebSphere, so you typically want Eclipse compiling against the **same JRE** used by the app server.\n\nIn Eclipse:\n\n- **Project → Properties → Java Build Path → Libraries**\n- Select **JRE System Library → Edit**\n- Choose **Alternate JRE**\n- **Installed JREs → Add… → Standard VM**\n- Browse to WebSphere’s JRE folder (example):\n\n- `C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\java\\8.0\\jre`\n\nApply and close.\n\n**Screenshots:** Project properties / JRE setup  \n![Project properties](/java_custom_max/2.properties.png)  \n![Java build path](/java_custom_max/3.java_build_path.png)  \n![Library

completion](/java_custom_max/9_JRE_after_compeletion.png)  \n![JRE configuration complete](/java_custom_max/5_java_jre_comp.png)\n\n---\n\n### 4) Add Maximo business objects classes to the build path\n\nNow add Maximo classes so your custom classes can extend Maximo base classes like `psdi.app.item.Item`.\n\nIn Eclipse:\n\n- **Project → Properties → Java Build Path → Libraries**\n- **Add External Class Folder**\n- Point it to the Maximo business objects classes folder (example shown in the workflow):\n\n- `C:\\IBM\\SMP761\\maximo\\applications\\maximo\\businessobjects\\classes`\n\nApply and close.\n\n**Screenshots:** Add external class folder  \n![Add external class folder](/java_custom_max/10_adding_external_class.png)  \n![External classes added](/java_custom_max/12_external_classes.png)\n\n---\n\n### 5) Create custom package + classes + interfaces\n\nCreate your package (example):\n\n- `cust.app.item`\n\n**Screenshots:**  \n![Creating package](/java_custom_max/13_creating_package.png)  \n![Package created](/java_custom_max/14_package_created.png)\n\nCreate the following (minimal) classes and interfaces:\n\n#### Interfaces (Remote)\n\n```java\n// ItemRemote.java\npublic interface ItemRemote extends psdi.app.item.ItemRemote{\n}\n\n// ItemSetRemote.java\npublic interface ItemSetRemote extends psdi.app.item.ItemSetRemote{\n}\n```\n\n#### Classes\n\n**ItemSet.java** — Tells Maximo to use your custom Item class\n\n```java\npublic class ItemSet extends psdi.app.item.ItemSet{\n    public ItemSet(MboServerInterface ms) throws RemoteException, MXException {\n        super(ms);\n    }\n    // getMboInstance() override goes here (see step 6)\n}\n```\n\n**Item.java** — Custom Item class (extend with your logic as needed)\n\n```java\npublic class Item extends psdi.app.item.Item{\n    public Item(MboSet ms) throws RemoteException, MXException {\n        super(ms);\n    }\n    // Add custom business logic here as needed\n}\n```\n\n**Screenshot:** class extension / code structure  \n![Extending Maximo Item class](/java_custom_max/15_extending_inventory_item_class.png)\n\n---\n\n### 6) Override `getMboInstance()` in `ItemSet`\n\nIn `ItemSet`, override `getMboInstance()` so Maximo instantiates your custom `Item` class.\n\n**CRITICAL:** Without this override, Maximo will create default `psdi.app.item.Item` instances, and your custom `save()` validation will NEVER be called!\n\n```java\n@Override\nprotected Mbo getMboInstance(MboSet mboSet) throws MXException, RemoteException {\n    // Create and return YOUR custom Item class instance\n    // This ensures Maximo calls YOUR save() method with validation logic\n    return new Item(mboSet);\n}\n```\n\nConceptually, you're telling the framework:\n\n> When this set needs an MBO instance, return _my_ custom Item, not the default one.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow 2 — Deploy the customization (“hotfix”) into Maximo\n\nThis section covers a “drop-in” deployment approach by updating the `businessobjects.jar` inside the deployed Maximo EAR.\n\n### 1) Locate the compiled `.class` files from Eclipse\n\nAfter compiling, your generated `.class` files will be in your Eclipse workspace project output directory, e.g.:\n\n- `Max761/bin/cust/app/item`\n\n**Screenshot:** locating compiled output  \n![Locate compiled classes](/java_custom_max/16_locate_compiled_class.png)\n\n---\n\n### 2) Stop the Maximo application server (WebSphere)\n\nIn the WebSphere admin console:\n\n- **Servers → Server Types → WebSphere application servers**\n- Stop the Maximo server\n\n**Screenshot:**  \n![Stop Maximo server](/java_custom_max/17_stop_maximo_server.png)\n\n---\n\n### 3) Find and extract `businessobjects.jar` from the deployed EAR\n\nNavigate to the deployed EAR path, something like:\n\n- `C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\...\\installedApps\\...\\MAX761.ear`\n\nLocate:\n\n- `businessobjects.jar`\n\nExtract its contents to a folder so you can add your custom classes.\n\n**Screenshot:**  \n![Extract businessobjects.jar](/java_custom_max/18_extract_businessobjects.png)\n\n---\n\n### 4) Delete `businessobjects.jar` from the EAR folder\n\nDelete the original jar from the EAR folder location (as shown in the workflow).  \nThis prepares for recreating the jar with your additions.\n\n> Tip: Keep a backup of the original jar somewhere safe before you delete/replace it.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Copy your compiled custom classes into the extracted jar folder\n\nCopy your `cust` package folder into the extracted `businessobjects.jar` contents:\n\n- Copy: `cust/...`\n- Into: extracted jar root (preserving package path)\n\n**Screenshot:**  \n![Copy customized classes](/java_custom_max/20_copy_the_customized_class.png)\n\n---\n\n### 6) Start the Maximo server again\n\nStart the Maximo WebSphere application server.\n\n**Screenshot:**  \n![Start Maximo server](/java_custom_max/21_start_the_maximo_server.png)\n\n---\n\n### 7) Point Maximo to your custom class via Database Configuration\n\nIn Maximo:\n\n- **System Configuration → Platform Configuration → Database Configuration**\n- Search for object: `ITEM`\n- Update the **Class** to: `cust.app.item.ItemSet`\n- Save\n- **Action → Manage Admin Mode**\n  - set admin sessions allowed = `0`\n  - Turn Admin Mode On\n- **Action → Apply Configuration Changes**\n  - run config (accept backup prompts)\n\n**Screenshots:** DB config before/after + apply  \n![Before DB config change](/java_custom_max/22_pre_db_config_change.png)  \n![After DB config change](/java_custom_max/23_post_db_config_change.png)  \n![Apply DB config](/java_custom_max/24_apply_db_config.png)  \n![Checking changes status](/java_custom_max/25_checking_changes_status_change.png)\n\nIf you hit an error during apply/config, capture it and validate:\n\n- your classes are in the jar correctly\n- package names match exactly\n- you rebuilt and copied the latest `.class` files\n- the server was fully restarted after jar changes\n\n---\n\n### 7) Verify the customization in Item Master\n\nFinally, verify that your custom Item class is being used:\n\n- Go to **Item Master**\n- Open an ITEM with active status\n- Try to change it status other than active\n- You will get a system message\n- The expected behavior\n\nThe item should save successfully (confirming your custom `Item` class is instantiated via `getMboInstance()`)\n\n**Screenshot:**  \n![Error message](/java_custom_max/26_geting_an_error_message.png)\n\nYour custom class is now active and ready for additional business logic as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Notes (Professional Reality Check)\n\n- This approach is effective for learning and quick validation, but you should align with your org’s official Maximo deployment practices (build pipelines, packaging conventions, environments, promotion process).\n- Keep backups before modifying deployed EAR/JAR artifacts.\n- Treat this as a controlled hotfix workflow—document what changed, when, and why.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Checklist (TL;DR)\n\n- [ ] Create Eclipse Java project (`JavaSE-1.8`)\n- [ ] Point project JRE to WebSphere JRE\n- [ ] Add Maximo `businessobjects\\classes` to build path\n- [ ] Create package `cust.app.item`\n- [ ] Create `ItemSetRemote` and `ItemRemote` interfaces\n- [ ] Create `ItemSet` class with `getMboInstance()` override\n- [ ] Create `Item` class extending `psdi.app.item.Item`\n- [ ] Compile all classes\n- [ ] Copy compiled `.class` files into extracted `businessobjects.jar` contents\n- [ ] Replace/update jar inside deployed EAR\n- [ ] Restart server\n- [ ] Update Database Configuration → object `ITEM` → class `cust.app.item.ItemSet`\n- [ ] Apply configuration changes\n- [ ] Verify in Item Master\n\n---\n\n## Complete Source Code\n\nBelow is the complete source code for all custom classes in the
