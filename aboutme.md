Hey there! I’m Syed Asad Zaman, and first and foremost, I’m a Muslim. By day, I work as a consultant at IBM, but when I’m not solving problems at work, you’ll probably find me behind a camera, volunteering, or diving into something new to learn—because being a perpetual student is just who I am.

I’m deeply fascinated by technology, especially the mind-blowing advancements in Artificial Intelligence and the broader computing world. But here’s the thing: while I love exploring what tech can do, I believe it’s important to remember that technology is just a tool—a powerful one, yes—but it can never replace the unique brilliance of human creativity, empathy, and thought.

What else is there to know?

### My story
