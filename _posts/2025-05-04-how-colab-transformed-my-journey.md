Weâ€™ve all had those moments â€” a spark, an unexpected encounter, or a place that quietly changes the trajectory of your life. For me, that place was COLAB.

In a previous blog post, I briefly mentioned COLAB while talking about communication skills. But honestly, a footnote doesnâ€™t do it justice. This initiative wasnâ€™t just a side project during my undergrad years â€” it was a turning point. It shaped how I think, how I work, and even how I show up in professional spaces like IBM today.

## Growth in Action

COLAB is a research and learning space at FAST NUCES Peshawar. It was launched in 2017 by Dr. Mohammad Nauman â€” a name that comes up often in my story for good reason. His vision was clear and refreshingly simple: build a space where students from different academic years could come together, share ideas, and grow â€” not through rigid structures, but through curiosity and collaboration.

There were no exams. No grades. No "outcomes." Just one requirement: be present.

Each week, students would share what they were working on. These presentations â€” casual and often impromptu â€” created a ripple effect of knowledge-sharing. A first-year student could learn Linux tricks from a senior; a third-semester coder could get feedback on a web app from someone who had built something similar last month. It was fluid, honest, and surprisingly effective.

Iâ€™ll never forget my first presentation. I was nervous, underprepared, and honestly? It was a mess. But no one laughed. No one dismissed me. Instead, I got questions, suggestions, and a reason to do better next time.

And I did.

Week after week, I presented. Slowly, that shaky voice became steadier. I went from barely managing 5-minute talks to confidently speaking in front of 100+ people. That kind of growth doesnâ€™t come from textbooks â€” it comes from being part of a community that expects your best and supports you on the way there.

By the end of our second semester, we were already building web apps. Linux became second nature â€” and yes, Iâ€™ll say it: if youâ€™re still clinging to Windows and calling yourself a developer... we need to talk ðŸ˜„.

By our fourth and fifth semesters, we were exploring cloud computing, DevOps pipelines, and functional programming â€” way ahead of the formal curriculum. We werenâ€™t just learning; we were applying.

We even hosted workshops on DevOps and web development. And these werenâ€™t senior projects â€” they were led by students in their fourth semester. Thatâ€™s the kind of confidence COLAB instilled in us.

## The Ripple Effect

The results spoke for themselves. Many of us started freelancing or working part-time while still in university. Some internships turned into long-term jobs. Others who werenâ€™t part of COLAB saw what we were doing, got inspired, and started learning and applying the same skills on their own â€” even though they never actually joined the space.

By the time graduation rolled around, about 90% of our batch already had job offers in hand. That stat alone is a testament to whatâ€™s possible when learning is driven by passion rather than pressure.

## Why COLAB Still Matters

Fast forward to my time at IBM, and I started seeing echoes of COLAB in the professional world. Agile teams, peer learning, internal communities â€” these concepts are gaining ground in global organizations. And itâ€™s not just a trend. It works.

COLAB wasnâ€™t a one-off experiment. It was a living model of how freedom, collaboration, and purpose can lead to powerful outcomes. And I truly believe that if more institutions and companies adopted this mindset, theyâ€™d unlock the same magic.


## A Lesson Worth Sharing

If thereâ€™s one thing COLAB taught me, itâ€™s this: when the right people come together with the right intent, incredible things can happen. It didnâ€™t require fancy labs or big budgets. It just needed trust, time, and the willingness to learn â€” together.

And maybe thatâ€™s the most important lesson of all. Whether youâ€™re a student, a team lead, or just someone trying to get better at what you do â€” seek out (or create) your own COLAB. The results might surprise you.
