After spending over two years working in the industry, someone once asked me:

> “What’s the most valuable skill you’ve gained?”

Without a second thought, my answer was: **communication skills** — which, by the way, includes **presentation skills** too.

### The Turning Point

I still remember being confused during my university days, wondering why we were being asked to work so much on our presentation skills.

> *“We’re not going into teaching or academia, so what’s the point?”*

Back then, it didn’t make sense. But now, after some real-world experience, I see things differently.

The truth is — **communication is just as important as technical expertise**. In the real world, you’re never working in isolation. You’re constantly part of a team, and more often than not, you’ll be collaborating with people from other departments too. That’s where communication becomes essential. And it’s not just about speaking clearly — it’s about writing effective emails, explaining your ideas, and yes, presenting your work in a way that makes people _actually care_.

### Don’t Underestimate Presentation Skills

**Presentation skills** in particular are often underestimated.

But here’s the thing: you could build something amazing, something that took weeks or months of effort. But if you can’t present it well — if your audience doesn’t understand its value — then all that hard work risks being overlooked or dismissed.

A good presentation doesn’t just inform. It tells a story. It makes your work memorable.

### The People Who Helped Me Grow

I was lucky to have mentors who helped shape these skills in me. (Fun fact: I was a _huge_ introvert when I first started university.)

One person I absolutely have to mention is [**Ma’am Abida**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abida-aabi-confidence-building-coach-nlp-therapist-977315201). I took two courses with her, and believe me — those classes were game-changers. By the time I was done, my confidence and communication had leveled up in a big way.

Another mentor who played a key role in my development was [**Dr. Muhammad Nauman**](https://recluze.net) — also known as [**Mohmmad Nauman on LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/recluze). His approach to teaching and mentorship pushed me to think deeply, communicate clearly, and challenge my own limits.

Then there was **COLAB**, a research lab I was part of (a story for another day). That place gave me the space and support to keep practicing my presentation skills, surrounded by some truly incredible people.

### Your Next Step

So, if you’re currently in undergrad — or about to graduate — here’s a little advice:

**Invest in your communication and presentation skills.**  
They’ll serve you not just in your career, but in your personal life too. Trust me, it’s a game-changer.

#### Here’s a Challenge

Prepare a 2-minute talk about something you’re passionate about — anything — and share it with a friend, classmate, or mentor this week.

Watch how the feedback you get sparks new ideas, builds your confidence, and makes you see your ideas more clearly.

Because when you master communication, you don’t just share your work — **you bring it to life**.

And that, more than anything else, will change everything.
