excerpt: "Coding isn’t dead—it’s evolving. Why understanding the fundamentals still matters in a post-AI world."

Back in university, I noticed something funny about computing students. By the second semester, you could spot it easily.

## The Coding Lovers

The first group loved coding. They enjoyed solving problems, writing code from scratch, and figuring things out on their own. Assignments and projects? Bring it on. Courses like communication or English? Sometimes annoying, but they cared more about understanding than taking shortcuts. They were the “I’ll keep debugging until it works” kind of students.

## The “Avoid-Coding” Crowd

Then there was the second group—the exact opposite.

They avoided coding whenever they could. They liked anything that didn’t involve deep programming: management, UI/UX, random testing tasks—basically anything that let them stay away from code. Some were there just for the social scene, happy to rely on others to do the hard work. Coding scared them, and honestly, can you blame them? Spending hours debugging alone sounds like punishment. They preferred working in groups and doing tasks that didn’t need heavy thinking.

Even back then, and still today, my belief is simple: if coding makes you nervous in computing, something important is missing. Even in low-code or no-code tools, understanding what’s happening under the hood is necessary. Without that, real depth is impossible.

## Coding in the Age of AI

Fast forward to 2025, after ChatGPT arrived. Things have changed, but not in the way many think.

Some students believe coding is “over.” Sure. Right. This idea worries students who love coding and makes the code-averse feel confident. Both are wrong.

Coding isn’t going away; it’s just changing. AI copilots and language models help write code, but understanding the basics is still key. People who know how programs really work will always matter.

### Advice for Coders

For students who love coding: keep practicing. Don’t let AI do all the thinking for you. Solve problems yourself. That struggle is your advantage.

### Advice for the Avoiders

For those who avoided coding before: now is the best time to start. You don’t have to memorize strange syntax or spend hours fixing errors. Focus on the basics: variables, loops, arrays, and simple data structures. Once you understand these, learning new languages or tools becomes much easier.

## The Bottom Line

Understanding programming is still important. Without it, growth in any computing role—technical or managerial—is slow.

Programming isn’t dead. It has adapted. The tools may have changed, but the need to know what’s happening under the hood hasn’t. The foundation still matters—and it always will.
